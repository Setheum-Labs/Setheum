# ECDP Setter Engine Module

## Overview

Provides Unegged ECDP `Setter (SETR)` Stablecoin on Ethical DeFi.

The Setter is Ethical DeFi's flagship stablecoin, built on the `ECDP` (Ethical Collateralised Debt Position), the Unpegged ECDP Stablecoin Protocol of the Ethical DeFi Suite is inspired by MakerDAO's and RAI's design, natively built on the Setheum Network with Zero-interest loans with optimisations and native liquidation protocols which include our on-chain built-in DEX Edfis, a native auction system, as well as an on-chain native liquidation protection mechanism. The Setter uses a system we call `LVSI` (Low Volatility Stable Index) which makes the stablecoin float without a peg while remaining stable-ish, it is over-collateralised by the Setheum's native currency `SEE`.
