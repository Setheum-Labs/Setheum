# Edfis Launchpool Module
Edfis Launchpool is a platform for projects to offer their tokens to their community (IDO) on Edfis while listing their liquidity pool on the exchange.

## Overview

This module is used for Edfis Launchpools. Teams and projects that are just getting started launching their products would need to foster a community and provide their tokens to the public. They need community backed by token holders of their token, that is the crowd so that they could have a strong start. 

The Launchpool does not replace the Launchpad but is however complementary to it.

The Launchpool module allows teams to offer their tokens to users in a pool wherein they stake `SEE`, `EDF`, `SETR` or `USSD` in order to earn the team's new token passively.
